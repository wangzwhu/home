Thanks to its convincing performance and high interpretability, GNNs have been widely employed to represent various kinds of multimedia data, such as social networks, 3D point clouds, natural languages, etc.</p><p>While GNNs have progressed in multimedia representation learning, GNN models still remain challenging in offering satisfactory representation for multimedia data, e.g., constructing the underlying graph, designing deep GNN representation, addressing dynamic graph structures, etc. Moreover, how to develop scalable GNNs for large-scale multimedia data still requires many efforts.</p><p>This <a href="http://www.2020.ieeeicme.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICMEâ€™20</a> special session serves as a forum for researchers from academia and industry to share their insights and cutting-edge results in GNNs for multimedia representation learning. Both theoretical development and applications of GNNs are welcome for submission. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p><ul>
<li>Graph learning in GNNs for multimedia representation</li>
<li>GNNs for deep multimedia representation learning</li>
<li>GNNs for time-varying multimedia representation learning</li>
<li>Scalable GNNs for large-scale multimedia data</li>
<li>Directed GNNs for asymmetric multimedia representation</li>
<li>Generative GNN models for multimedia data</li>
<li>GNNs for innovative multimedia applications, such as person reidentification, social network analysis, point cloud processing, image retrieval, recommendation systems and so on</li>
